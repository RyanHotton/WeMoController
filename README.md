# WeMoController
This Application is designed to work with a Belkin WeMo Switch.
Currently this is a simple prototype.


## Instructions:
1. Enter a the WeMo Switch's IP Address
2. Click ON or OFF.

### Future:
To integrate searching of for WeMo devices.
Cross Platform.
Better UI.
Faster.
More ideas to come.

#### Inspiration:
This program was inspired by Barnacules Nerdgasm's code and video on how to control a Belkin WeMo switch to control his modem.
We used the ON and OFF command sending code. May use his library in the future, but we will probably design that ourselves.
