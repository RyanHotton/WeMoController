# WeMoController
This Application is designed to work with a Belkin WeMo Switch.
Currently this is a simple prototype.
### New Branch created WeMoControllerV2
### Project has been delayed...until further notice

# UPDATE - We are switching to another language for cross-platform compatibility.
### Possible languages are:
- Java
- Python


## Instructions:
- 1. Enter a the WeMo Switch's IP Address
- 2a. Click ON or OFF buttons.
- 2b. Click the TOGGLE button.

### Present status:
- Looking into cross platform, may recreate the current state of the project into another language.
- Figuring out device locator.
- Expect delays as this is a personal project and the team on this project are students.

### Future:
- To integrate searching of for WeMo devices.
- Cross Platform.
- Better UI.
- Faster.
- More ideas to come.

#### Inspiration:
- This program was inspired by Barnacules Nerdgasm's code and video on how to control a Belkin WeMo switch to control his modem.
- We used the ON and OFF command sending code. May use his library in the future, but we will probably design that ourselves.
