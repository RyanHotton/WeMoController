## WeMoController ##
----------

### History: ###
This application first started as a fun C# application (inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/ifzmJFdvNEE)). I wanted to make a desktop application to control your Belkin WeMo Switches, instead of pulling out your phone and using the command line. 

After making a working version that required the user to input the desired WeMo's IP address and toggle the switch On/Off, I decided to put the project on hold and focus on school and work. The intention was to always finish this project in C#, but I started to use Windows 7 (at the time) less and less and I started using MacOS and Linux distros. With C# (at the time) not being that popular on other operating systems I decided to work look at different avenues. 

The goal with the new application is to be cross-platform. My current plan is to change the application from a desktop application to a web application (via localhost). Please note that I may change my mind and go back to a desktop application.

## Roadmap: ##
- Choose either Python 3 or Node.js
- Get the basic SOAP communication working with IP addresses (equivalent to the original C# application)
- Allow the application to fetch the Belkin WeMo Switches dynamically (a feature that was never completed in C#)
- TBD
